# The Famous Share Monitor Project

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ralfholly/sharemon.svg?branch=master)


## Setting up the Environment

In order to set up the development environment, you first have to install all requirements of this project in a local virtual environment:

```
make requirements
```

You need to do this (normally) only once, unless a new dependency on a Python package was introduced.

Once the local virtual environment is installed, you can activate it by *sourcing* the `env.sh` script:

```
. ./env.sh
```
